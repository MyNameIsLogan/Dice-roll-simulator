# Dice-roll-simulator
The dice will allow the user to roll a randomly generated number depending on selected dice. Users will be told what number they rolled and will be able to re-roll or quit the program.  
The code will allow users to roll up to three dice and tell them what each individual dice rolled as well as acquire a total between all of the dice.
A further element of customization I want to add is allowing for different numbers of sides on the dice. The options will be D2 (coin flip), D6 (standard dice), D8, D10, and D20.
