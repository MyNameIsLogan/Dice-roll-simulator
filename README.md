# Dice-roll-simulator
The dice will allow the user to roll a randomly generated number depending on what kind of dice the user selects (the standard dice would roll one through six). The code would tell the user what number they rolled and allow them to re-roll or quit the program.  
I plan to add the option to use up to three dice. The code will tell the user what each individual dice rolled as well as acquire a total between all of the dice. Users are able to select whether they want to roll one, two, or three dice at the beginning of the roll.
A further element of customization I want to add is allowing for different numbers of sides on the dice. The options will be D2 (coin flip), D6 (standard dice), D8, D10, and D20. This many customization settings will add an appropriate challenge to creating the code.
