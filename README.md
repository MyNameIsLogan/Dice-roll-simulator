# Dice-roll-simulator
The dice will allow the user to roll a randomly generated number depending on selected dice. Users will be told what number they rolled and will be able to re-roll or quit the program.  
The code will allow users to roll any number of dice they want and tell them what each individual dice rolled.
A further element of customization I want to add is allowing for different numbers of sides on the dice. Users can input any number for dice sides.
